From decryption function and given o to e
o -> e
m -> a
t -> l

1. Try u -> i since it is alone a lot and we already have m -> a
2. Try n -> m for the 4th line a_ after I
3. Try x -> n for the 4th line ma_
4. Try b -> o and j -> w to get the word now in line 2
5. Try s -> t for the word not on line 4
6. Try q -> d for the word need on the second to last line
7. Try h -> y
       l -> s
       a -> t  to get the word yesterday throughout the text

       This is where I realized the song is Yesterday by the Beatles in 1965
